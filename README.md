Calla & Ivi wanted to increase its sales by 10% by the end of the first quarter of the year.

The marketing team decided to launch a traffic campaign to their website to achieve this goal, in search of more customers.

The measurement of this goal in traffic was carried out through the clicks of the advertisements to the website.
